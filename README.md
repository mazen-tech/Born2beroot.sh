## ABOUT
This system administration project focuses on setting up a secure virtual machine. It covers key topics such as virtualization, partitioning, LVM, command-line tools, SSH, and system security measures like sudo, firewalls, and password policies. The project repository includes a script for automated tasks and the virtual machine signature.



## MANDATORY
> During the evaluation, I was asked questions about the topics below;
- [x] Choose between two Linux-based operating systems: `Rocky` or `Debian`;
- [x] Create at least 2 encrypted partitions using `LVM`;
- [x] Ensure `SSH services` are running on specific ports;
- [x] Configure a `UFW firewall` and leave only port `4242` open;
- [x] Set up the `hostname` (will be changed during evaluation) and a strong `password policy` for all users;
- [x] Set up a strong `sudo` configuration;
- [x] Create a `monitoring script` that displays specific information every 10 minutes at server startup;

## BONUS
> During the evaluation, also had to justify my choices;
- [x] Set up a different partition structure;
- [x] Set up a functional `WordPress` website with the following services: `lighttpd`, `MariaDB` and `PHP`;
- [x] Set up a service of my own choice that I think is useful (justify that choice);

## commands you need to know
#### uname -a

```bash
is used in Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux) to display system information. When you execute uname -a, it prints out various details about the system, including:

Kernel name
Network node hostname
Kernel release
Kernel version
Machine hardware architecture
Operating system
```

#### grep "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l

```bash
This command counts the number of physical CPU IDs listed in the /proc/cpuinfo file and prints the count
```

#### grep "processor" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l
```bash
This command counts the number of processor entries listed in the /proc/cpuinfo file and prints the count
```

#### free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $2}'
```bash
This command retrieves and prints the total physical memory available in megabytes by filtering the output of the free command using awk
```

#### free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $3}'
```bash
This command retrieves and prints the amount of used physical memory in megabytes by filtering the output of the free command using awk
```

#### vmstat 1 2 | tail -1 | awk '{printf $15}'
```bash
This command prints the value of the 15th column of the output from vmstat 1 2 command after filtering through tail, displaying the second set of statistics
```

#### who -b | awk '$1 == "system" {print $3 " " $4}'
```bash
This command extracts and prints the system boot time by filtering the output of the who -b command using awk, displaying the date and time
```
#### ss -ta | grep ESTAB | wc -l
```bash
This command counts the number of established (ESTAB) connections by filtering the output of ss -ta command using grep, then using wc -l to count the lines
```

#### hostname -I
```bash
The command hostname -I displays the IP addresses associated with the current system's hostname. It prints the IP addresses on a single line, separated by spaces
```

#### ip link | grep "link/ether" | awk '{print $2}'
```bash
This command extracts and prints the MAC addresses of network interfaces by filtering the output of ip link
```

#### journalctl _COMM=sudo | grep COMMAND | wc -l
```bash
This command counts the occurrences of the string "COMMAND" within the logs generated by the sudo command in the systemd journal
```
